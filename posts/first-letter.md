# My First Week in Schmalkalden

*January 15, 2024*

Hello everyone!

I'm writing this from my cozy little room in Schmalkalden, and I still can't believe I'm actually here! After months of planning, paperwork, and anticipation, I've finally arrived in Germany to begin my studies.

## The Journey Begins

The flight was long but exciting. As the plane descended over Frankfurt, I could see the beautiful German landscape below – rolling hills, dense forests, and charming little towns. It was like something out of a fairy tale.

The train ride from Frankfurt to Schmalkalden was equally magical. The German countryside passed by my window, and I found myself constantly reaching for my camera to capture every moment.

## First Impressions

Schmalkalden is smaller than I expected, but it's absolutely charming. The town has this medieval feel with its cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses. Walking through the town center feels like stepping back in time, yet it's perfectly modern with all the amenities a student could need.

The university campus is beautiful, nestled among trees and hills. The buildings are a mix of old and new architecture, creating a unique atmosphere that I'm already falling in love with.

## The Challenges

Of course, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. The language barrier is real – while many people speak English, I'm determined to learn German properly. I've already started with basic phrases and numbers, and I practice with anyone who's patient enough to listen!

The weather is also quite different from what I'm used to. It's much colder here, and I'm still getting used to the German winter. But there's something magical about seeing snow-covered rooftops and breathing in the crisp air.

## What's Next

I'm excited about the classes that will start next week. The academic system here seems quite different from what I'm used to, but I'm ready to embrace the challenge. I've already met a few other international students, and we're planning to explore the town together this weekend.

I promise to share more stories as my journey unfolds. There's so much to discover, so many experiences to document, and I can't wait to share them all with you.

Thanks for reading!
